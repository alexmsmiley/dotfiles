DOTFILES ALL OVER THE PLACE
===========================

At this point these dotfiles are tailored for git-bash (MinGW) running under windows.  Eventually I'd like to incorporate my dotfiles from Ubuntu, Mac and Cygwin.  I want all my accustomed aliases to always be available in all of those environments so I don't have to think so much about which machine/platform I'm using.

I'm striving for modularity: don't know if you'd get any benefit from taking these dotfiles wholesale, but if you see something handy that you don't already have, grab it and have fun.
